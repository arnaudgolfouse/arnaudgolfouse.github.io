<ul>
<li>When we say 'Download and install', it means downloading the file, double-clicking it to launch the installer, and then follow the installation instructions.</li>
<li>If multiple installers are proposed and you don't known which one you should choose, you should usually take the version that says 64-bits.</li>

<li>If you don't feel secure about something, don't hesitate to ask the internet/me :)</li>
