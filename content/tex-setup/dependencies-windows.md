This describes the dependencies needed on Windows. (This was tested on Windows 10)

### Notes

- When we say 'Download and install', it means downloading the file, double-clicking it to launch the installer, and then follow the installation instructions.
- If multiple installers are proposed and you don't known which one you should choose, you should usually take the version that says 64-bits.
- Some of the dependencies listed here might trigger your antivirus. In case of doubt:
  - If the download comes from an address that start with `https://`, this is usually fine.
  - If you don't feel secure about something, don't hesitate to ask the internet/me :)
